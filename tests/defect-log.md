## DEF-001: Pickup Request Scheduling and Storage Issues

**Related Test Case(s):** TC-SM-004, TC-MT-006  
**Functional Requirement Covered:** FR-013, FR-027  
**Environment:** Local React App (`http://localhost:3000/`), Chrome  
**Reported By:** @samuel-kimwele-mbai  
**Priority:** High  
**Severity:** High  
**Date Reported:** 2025-07-09  

### Description
When a user schedules a pickup:
- The system allows scheduling for past dates (e.g., `2025-07-10`), violating FR-013.
- The request is not saved in `localStorage` or reflected on the Dashboard, violating FR-027.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the CleanCity app in Chrome (`http://localhost:3000/`).
2. Log in with email: `user1@test.com`, password: `Test123!`.
3. Navigate to the **Scheduling page**.
4. Set pickup date to a past date (`2025-07-10`) and submit.
5. Go to **Dashboard**, record pickups count.
6. Schedule a new pickup via the **Pickup Scheduler** form.
7. Inspect `localStorage` and Dashboard.

### Expected Result
- Past date scheduling shows error: ‚ÄúCannot schedule past date.‚Äù
- Valid pickup details persist in `localStorage` under `scheduledPickups`.
- Dashboard count updates automatically.

### Actual Result
- No error for past dates; request is saved.
- No pickup data saved in `localStorage`.
- Dashboard count unchanged.

### Impact
Accepting past dates and failing to save requests lead to data inaccuracies and broken core functionality.

### Attachments
- Screenshots of storage check and dashboard state.

### Proposed Fix
- Add client-side validation to reject past dates and display error.

- Update Dashboard to reflect new requests.
