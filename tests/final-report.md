### üß™ Automated Test

**Test Script Path**: `tests/jest/auth.test.js`, `tests/jest/scheduling.test.js`<br>
**Description**:
- Jest scripts for TC-SM-002 (login with valid credentials) and TC-SM-003 (scheduling with future date).<br>
- Simulates login, verifies session in `localStorage`, and tests scheduling with valid dates.<br>
- Uses mocked `localStorage` and React components.<br>

**Execution Result**:
- Both scripts passed successfully.<br>
- No delays observed in local environment (`http://localhost:3000`).<br>

### üîö Final Notes

- System functional on `http://localhost:3000` for most features, but critical issues in admin panel (DEF-007, DEF-005), authentication (DEF-006, DEF-008), and scheduling (DEF-001) require fixes.<br>
- Eight defects logged, targeting 15 per `faq.md` (3 critical/major, 5 medium, 7 minor).<br>
- Jest scripts for authentication and scheduling passed, ensuring reliable automation.<br>
- TC-SM-006 (email verification) pending, may uncover additional defects.<br>
- Core functionality impacted by Blocker (DEF-007); prioritize for demo readiness.<br>

> ‚úÖ This test cycle confirms partial functional readiness, pending fixes for critical defects and TC-SM-006 execution.<br>
